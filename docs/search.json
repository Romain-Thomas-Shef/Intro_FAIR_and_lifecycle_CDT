    "text": "Code Testing\n\n\n Who: Sylvia Whittle, Michael Foster\nWhen/Length: 12/3\n\n\n\nAbstract:\n\nDoes your code work? Are you sure? How do you ensure that it keeps working when you change it? Manually verifying is slow and tedious. Why not automate it? Software testing checks that your code works for you, and when it breaks, it can show you exactly where it broke, without you having to trawl through hundreds of lines of code manually.This course aims to provide you with the tools you need to start automatically ensuring the reliability of your code."

    "text": "Reproducible Environments\n\n\n Who: Dan Brady\nWhen/Length: 30/4\n\n\n Abstract:\nEnsuring that others are able to take your code, run it, and are able to produce the same (or equivalent) results is one of the key tenets of FAIR and reproducible research software. This course will provide you with an overview of different ways to make your code reproducible and then focus on virtual environments as a specific tool for computational reproducibility."
