## The FAIR principles

<br>
“Many of the FAIR Guiding Principles can be directly applied to research software by treating software and data as similar digital research objects. However, <span style="color:red">specific characteristics of software — such as its executability, composite nature, and continuous evolution and versioning</span> — make it necessary to revise and extend the principles.”

<font size="4">[Chue Hong, Neil P. et al, FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles)](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00068)</font>


## Findable {.smaller}

**Software, and its associated metadata, is easy for both humans and machines to find.**

<font size=6>
<ol type="1">
<li>Software is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Components of the software representing levels of granularity are assigned distinct identifiers.</li>
        <li>Different versions of the software are assigned distinct identifiers.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Software is described with rich metadata.</li>
<li>Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the software they describe.</li>
<li>Metadata are FAIR, searchable and indexable.</li>
</ol>
</font>

<font size=4>[Barker *et al.* *Scientific Data* 9:622 (2022) "Introducing the FAIR Principles for research software" DOI: 10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x)</font>


## Accessible 

**Software, and its metadata, is retrievable via standardised protocols.**

<font size=6>
<ol type="1">
<li>Software is retrievable by its identifier using a standardised communications protocol.
    <ol type="i">
        <li>The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.</li>
        <li>The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Metadata are accessible, even when the software is no longer available.</li>
</ol>
</font>

<font size=4>[Barker *et al.* *Scientific Data* 9:622 (2022) "Introducing the FAIR Principles for research software" DOI: 10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x)</font>

## Interoperable

**Software interoperates with other software by exchanging data and/or metadata, and/or through interaction via application programming interfaces (APIs), described through standards.**

<font size=6>
<ol type="1">
<li>Software reads, writes and exchanges data in a way that meets domain-relevant community standards.</li>
<li>Software includes qualified references to other objects.</li>
</ol>
</font>

## Reusable

**Software is both usable (can be executed) and reusable (can be understood, modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software).**

<font size=6>
<ol type="1">
<li>Software is described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Software is given a clear and accessible license.</li>
        <li>Software is associated with detailed provenance.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Software includes qualified references to other software.</li>
<li>Software meets domain-relevant community standards.</li>
</ol>

## University's position about FAIR {.smaller}

<br>
‘‘We aspire to open research culture that values a diverse range of contributions and adheres to the FAIR principles to enable the results of our research to be of maximum benefit to society (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable), whilst also respecting circumstances that limit data sharing (for example, due to issues of privacy, non-consent, contractual agreements, legislation or practicality).’’  
[University of Sheffield, Statement on Open Research](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/openresearch/university-statement-open-research)
<br><br>
‘‘All researchers, including postgraduate research students, have a personal responsibility to manage effectively the data they create….. All researchers are expected to document research data and software in line with the FAIR principles…..’’

<ins>Abstract:</ins> 
If you’ve never heard of or used version control and Git before this is the course for you. We start by introducing version control and exploring how it can be beneficial to researchers, then we introduce some useful tools and get started with some basic workflow using these tools. We build on those foundations with collaborative exercises that introduce key concepts such as forks, pull requests and branches and give you the chance to <span style="color:red">*get some hands-on experience with using version control in a research setting*</span>.

This course aims to help you develop a <span style="color:red">*deeper understanding of how Git works to facilitate collaboration*</span>. It builds on foundations laid by the Git beginners course. The core idea around the course is that by improving your understanding of working with branches and how to make your commits tidier and neater it makes it easier to understand pull requests and Git history which in turn makes it easier to collaborate and work on code with others (including your future self!).

<ins>Abstract:</ins>  

The way you write your code will have a massive impact on how easy it is to maintain in the long run. <span style="color:red">*This course on Code Design introduces essential principles and best practices for writing clean and maintainable code*</span>. We will learn how we can write clean code, adhering to naming conventions, commenting, and following PEP 8 guidelines. We will then explore some fundamental principles such as DRY, KISS or YAGNI that are important to keep in mind when writing new code and see how we can spend less time touching the code by introducing configuration files and command line interface.

Does your code work? Are you sure? How do you ensure that it keeps working when you change it? Manually verifying is slow and tedious. Why not automate it? Software testing checks that your code works for you, and when it breaks, it can show you exactly where it broke, without you having to trawl through hundreds of lines of code manually.<span style="color:red">*This course aims to provide you with the tools you need to start automatically ensuring the reliability of your code.*</span>

<ins>Abstract:</ins>  

Ensuring that others are able to take your code, run it, and are able to produce the same (or equivalent) results is one of the key tenets of FAIR and reproducible research software. <span style="color:red">*This course will provide you with an overview of different ways to make your code reproducible*</span> and then focus on virtual environments as a specific tool for computational reproducibility.

<ins>Abstract:</ins>  

Did you know that you can actually publish a paper about your software? This is an ideal way to get recognition (and citation) for the software you have spent countless hours creating. <span style="color:red">*In this course we will walk you through an example of submission in the Journal of open Source software.*</span> We will make an example software submission to the journal, and thanks to the collaboration of the Editor in Chief of JOSS (Arfon Smith), we will look at how the review process is done.
